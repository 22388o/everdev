# What is TONDEV?
TONDEV an Node.js package with CLI interface that allows to easily download and install all the core TON.DEV components in background and use them from a single interface.
Also, this project serves as a backend for [TONDEV VS Code plugin](https://github.com/tonlabs/tondev-vscode). 


## What components does it support?

These components are supported or will be supported soon.  
Each component is downloaded and installed automatically for the target platform upon the first request.

- [Solidity Compiler](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler)
- [TON-SDK](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK)
- [C/C++ Compiler](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Compiler) - SOON
- [TON OS Startup Edition](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-se) – SOON
- [TestSuite4](https://github.com/tonlabs/TestSuite4) – SOON
- [tonos-cli](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli) (installation only) – SOON

It can be extended with other tools following the [instructions of integration](#tondev-extensibility). 

# Installation

## Dependencies

- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) >= 10.x installed
- (optional) [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/)  >= 19.x installed
- Solidity compiler requires VC++ Runtime on Windows. You can install it from [the latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0).


**Install**

```shell
$ npm i -g tondev
```
**Update**

```shell
$ npm r -g tondev  
$ npm i -g tondev
```

# Supported commands

```shell
$ tondev
Use: tondev command args...
Version: 0.1.4
Commands:
    sol create   Create Solidity Contract
    sol compile  Compile Solidity Contract
    sol version  Show Solidity Version
    sol update   Update Solidity Compiler
    js create    Create TON JS App

```

**General command syntax**

```shell
$ tondev <tool> <command> ...args
```

# Solidity
## Create your first contract
This command creates a hello-world contract with comments that you can observe
and compile.

```shell
$ tondev sol create Contract
```

## Compile

This command compiles a selected contract. 
After successful compilation you get .abi.json and .tvc files that you can later [use in your DApps to deploy and call contract methods](https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/07f1a5-add-contract-to-your-app-/b/462f33).

```shell
$ tondev sol compile Contract.sol
```

## Version
This command shows the currently installed Solidity compiler version.

```shell
$ tondev sol version
```

## Update
This command updates the compiler to the latest version. 

```shell
$ tondev sol update
```

# SDK

## Create Demo Project

This command creates a Node.js project with SDK latest dependencies and jndex.js file with main Client object creation.

```shell
$ tondev js create
```

# TONDEV Extensibility

TON Dev Environment is an integration point for development tools related to Free TON Blockchain.

There are two kind of software connected to TONDev:

- Development tools such as a compilers, networks, debuggers and so on.
- User Interaction services such as an IDE plugins, CLI, GUI applications etc.
