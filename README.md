## What is TONDEV?

TONDEV is a Node.js package with CLI interface that allows to easily download and install all the core TON.DEV components in background and use them from a single interface.
Also, this project serves as a backend for [TONDEV VS Code extension](https://github.com/tonlabs/tondev-vscode).

### What components does it support?

These components are supported or will be supported soon.  
Each component is downloaded and installed automatically for the target platform upon the first request.

- [Debot](https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/72f1b7-debot-specifications) - **SOON**  
- [Solidity Compiler](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Solidity-Compiler)
- [C/C++ Compiler](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Compiler) - **SOON**  
- [TON OS Startup Edition](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-se) – 
  Local blockchain for development and testing
- [TestSuite4](https://github.com/tonlabs/TestSuite4) – **SOON**  
  Python lightweight framework for Solidity testing 
- [tonos-cli](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli) – **SOON** (installation only)     
  Command line tool for TON OS
- [TON-SDK](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK) -  **SOON**   
  Core SDK Library features. 

TONDEV can be extended with other tools following the [instructions of integration](#tondev-extensibility). 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) >= 10.x installed
- (optional) [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/)  >= 19.x installed
- Solidity compiler requires VC++ Runtime on Windows. You can install it from [the latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0).

### Install

```shell
npm i -g tondev
```

### Update

```shell
npm r -g tondev  
npm i -g tondev
```

## Use in JS applications

You can easily use tondev as a regular npm package in your JS applications.

Just add dependency into you `package.json`:

```shell
npm i -s tondev
```

And then run any command from tondev:

```js
const { consoleTerminal, runCommand } = require("tondev");
const path = require("path");

async function main() {
    await runCommand(consoleTerminal, "sol compile", {
        file: path.resolve(__dirname, "Hello.sol")
    });
}

main();
```

## Command Line Interface
### General command syntax

```shell
tondev <tool> <command> ...args
```

### Solidity

#### Create your first contract

This command creates a hello-world Solidity contract with comments that you can observe and compile.

```shell
tondev sol create Contract
```

#### Compile

This command compiles and links a selected Solidity contract. 
After successful compilation you get .abi.json and .tvc files that you can later [use in your DApps to deploy and call contract methods](https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/07f1a5-add-contract-to-your-app-/b/462f33).

```shell
tondev sol compile Contract.sol
```

#### Version

This command shows the currently installed Solidity compiler version.

```shell
tondev sol version
```

#### Update

This command updates the compiler to the latest version.

```shell
tondev sol update
```

### SDK

#### Create Demo Project

This command creates a Node.js project with SDK latest dependencies and index.js file with main Client object creation.

```shell
tondev js create
```

## TONDEV Extensibility

TON Dev Environment is an integration point for development tools related to Free TON Blockchain.

There are two kind of software connected to TONDev:

- Development tools such as a compilers, networks, debuggers and so on.
- User Interaction services such as an IDE plugins, CLI, GUI applications etc.
