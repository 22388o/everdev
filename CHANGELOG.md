# Release Notes

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.0] - 2021-07-15

### New

- `value` option of the `contract` commands can accept values with "t" suffix.
  Such values will be properly converted to the nano tokens.
- In case of error with giver the tondev prints new detailed error describing 
  that there is a giver problem (not in users contract). 
- Components version table has a text "not installed" if some component is missing.
  If some component is missing then tondev adds a footnote about on demand installation.
  

### Fixed

- "tondev clang set --compiler" didn't change installed compiler version https://github.com/tonlabs/tondev/issues/42
- check balance of the account before deploy.
- tondev does not fill the command args with default values when user ran commands programmatically.  

## [0.7.4] - 2021-06-25

### New

- Column `used` was added to  `signer list` with reference to the giver that uses this signer;
- Column `giver` was added to `network list` with information about giver's contract and signer.
- Printed tables now supports multiline cell values.

### Fixed

- "Error: Signer not found:" in case when the default signer has upper letters in name.
- Giver didn't use default signer. From now the giver uses default signer when User calls the `network giver` command without `--signer` option.

## [0.5.0] - 2021-04-23

### New
- `clang` controller for [C++ compiler](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Compiler):   
  install, compile with 1 command, manage versions, etc.   
- `signer` controller for signer registry management:   
  generate keys, import keys and mnemonics, specify default signer, etc.   
- `network` controller for network registry management:   
  add networks, configure network giver, specify default network, etc.   
- `contract` controller for contract management:   
- get contract info summary, top up balance, deploy, run, run-local, run-executor   
- `tondev js wrap` generates `code` and `codeHash` fields in addition to `tvc`.   
- `tondev contract info` prints code hash.   
- `tondev info` command prints a summary information from all controllers.   
- short aliases for controllers, commands and options.   
  For example instead of using `tondev network list`    
  you can use `tondev n l` and even shorter `tondev nl`.   

### Fixed

## [0.4.0] - 2021-03-25
