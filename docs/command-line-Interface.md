## Command Line Interface

### Quick start
Start testing your contracts without any delay with this guide. It will help you get test tokens in Developer Network, prepare your environment and test your first contract.
[Test my first contract!](../guides/work-with-contracts.md)

### General command syntax

```shell
everdev <tool> <command> ...args
```
Some tools (network, signer, contract, js) and commands have short aliases. For example instead of using `everdev network list` you can use `everdev n l` and even shorter `everdev nl`.
